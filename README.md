# Goalboost
Goalboost is an employee-owned software project, consisting of a time tracking API built on Eve.  Employee-owned, oh heck, what will that license look like?

Anything here is preliminary at this point, so what we have to date is basically a virtual environment
with Eve, the Eve demo, plus support for static files.
